# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
### Abstract
The goal for this analysis is to predict credit card fraud in the transactional data by applying Machine Learning Models. I will be using tensorflow to build the predictive model, and t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding for dimension reduction) to visualize the dataset in two dimensions at the end of this analysis.

### Dataset
The dataset for this project is available at Kaggle.com
